This feedback can be sourced from various channels: direct surveys, online reviews, social media comments, and customer support interactions. The objective is to understand their experiences, satisfaction levels, and areas where they think improvements are necessary. This analysis helps in refining the ICP, ensuring it remains relevant and accurate. By focusing on real user experiences and perceptions, the profile becomes more grounded in actual customer needs and preferences. This section would present a synthesized overview of the feedback, highlighting key themes and actionable insights.
